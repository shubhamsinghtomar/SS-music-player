# SS-music-player
Let's go through the code step by step:

We import the necessary libraries: pygame for playing music, tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), ttkthemes for applying a themed look to the GUI, mutagen for reading MP3 file metadata, and time for formatting song length.

We define four functions: load_music opens a file dialog to choose a music file and loads it into the music player; play_music starts playing the loaded music; pause_music pauses the music playback; stop_music stops the music and clears the song information.

We initialize the pygame library.

We create the main window using ThemedTk from ttkthemes and set the title.

We create a frame within the main window using ttk.Frame.

We create buttons for loading, playing, pausing, and stopping the music using ttk.Button and assign the corresponding functions to them.

We create a StringVar to store the song information and create a label to display it using ttk.Label.

We configure the grid layout and padding for the main window and frame.

We start the main loop using root.mainloop().

When you run this code, a GUI window will appear with buttons to load, play, pause, and stop music. The selected song's file name and length will be displayed below the buttons. You can click the buttons to control the music playback.

Please make sure you have the required libraries (pygame, ttkthemes, and mutagen) installed in your Python environment before running the code. You can install them using pip install pygame ttkthemes mutagen.
